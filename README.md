<h1>IT System Model Editor</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This application provides users with a platform for visualizing and editing IT system models represented as JSON files. It features secure login, a user-friendly dashboard for managing files, and a graphical editor for modifying system components.

The interface consists of three main areas:

Authentication (Login/Registration/Forgot Password)

Dashboard (File management and uploading)

Graphical Model Editor (Network visualization and editing)

<h2>Features</h2>
âœ… User Functionality
Login/Registration with secure credentials and password reset functionality.

Upload one or more JSON files representing IT system models.

View uploaded files in a sortable, filterable table.

Edit models through an interactive network graph:

Click on a node (computer) to view and edit its attributes.

Edit includes hostname, installed software, data attributes, and network connections.

Save changes to the server.

Download original or modified JSON files via a dropdown menu.

Real-time feedback through alerts for actions such as save success, errors, or delete confirmations.

<h2>User Flows</h2>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
