## 📘 Overview

**IT System Model Editor** is a web application that allows users to securely upload, view, and edit IT infrastructure models represented as JSON files. Through an interactive graphical editor, users can visualize IT systems as networks of nodes and make changes directly in the browser.

The application consists of:
- 🔐 Authentication (Login, Registration, Forgot Password)
- 📁 Dashboard (File upload and management)
- 🕸️ Graphical Model Editor (Network visualization and editing)

## ✨ Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Login, registration, and password reset with secure credential management (JWT-based).
  
- **JSON File Management**  
  Upload one or more JSON files representing IT systems. Files are displayed in a sortable, filterable table.

- **Graphical Editor**  
  Visualize JSON models as a network graph. Click on a node (e.g. a computer) to:
  - Edit computer name
  - View/edit installed software
  - View/edit data related to the computer (as tables)
  - Modify network connections

- **Real-Time Editing**  
  All changes are automatically refreshed and can be saved to the server.

- **Download Options**  
  Choose to download either the original or modified version of each model file.

- **User Feedback**  
  Alerts are shown for successful saves, errors, warnings, and confirmations.
